# Work-Day-Scheduler

Work-Day-Scheduler is an application for standard daily work hour schedule that uses color-code for each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed. It allow a user to enter an event when they click a coloured timeblock, and save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked for each timeblock.
